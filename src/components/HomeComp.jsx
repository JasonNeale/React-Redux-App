                <p>Cannabis use is on the rise in the United States. A 2018 study notes that, while cannabis use among teens has decreased, American adults are increasingly using cannabis on the daily.</p>
                <p>According to Forbes, the global cannabis industry is estimated to be worth $7.7 billion. Itâ€™s projected to hit $31.4 billion by 2021.</p>
                <p>The industry is booming in part because cannabis can be a versatile form of medication. A number of research studies have found that cannabis has the potential to help with a variety of medical conditions, including anxiety, chronic pain, and epilepsy.</p>
                <p>But, as any recreational or medical marijuana user can tell you, not all cannabis is created equal. Different strains of cannabis produce different effects, and thus can be used for different reasons.</p>
